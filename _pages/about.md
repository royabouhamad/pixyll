![First Intership](/images/me.jpg)

I'm Roy, 19, and I strive to challenge myself in whatever it is I do (be it coding or snowboarding). My main aim is to solve issues that are currently faced around the world throuh the use of technology.

My knowledge of code and computer science is constantly growing as I regularly teach myself to code using different languages and I currently have quite an extensive knowledge of Python and Java, as well as good knowledge of web developing languages(html, CSS, javascript). I enjoy building chatbots and applications with Python and am currently learning how to use Django in order to build more elegant websites. Although my Github presence is quite small at the moment, I aim to increase the number of repository's I currently have and share my code with the world as well as contributing to other open-source projects.

At A-Levels, I achieved 1 A* and 2 A's in Maths, Further Maths and Computer Science respectively and am currently studying for a Bachelors degree in Computer Science at the University of Bath. In the future, I see myself using my programming knowledge as a force for good be it through my own company or an already established company.
