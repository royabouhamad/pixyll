I recently had the opportunity to complete a week long internship at Zendesk's office in London. From this experience, I learnt a great deal and also met some really cool colleagues along the way.

How I got the internship...
---------------------------
Throughout the months of October and November, I took part in the Headstart program. This program was designed to allow young people to get ahead in their career, by guaranteeing them an interview, if they gave up at least 16 hours of their time to volunteer in their local community. At first, I was a little skeptical about the program and whether I would do it or not, however when I looked through the list of potential employers, one of them caught my eye. Zendesk. This program would give me the chance to interview with a tech company(my dream) if I completed 16 hours of volunteer work, and I wasn't going to let that opportunity to pass me by. I completed my 16 hours within a month and then waited for the pre-interview workshop to arrive. The workshop took place in March, at Zendesk's office in London, and went through the different departments that we could interview with the following week as well as who Zendesk were. The departments on offer were: Marketing, Customer Experience, Customer Support, Workplace Experience and Sales. After the workshop, we had to fill out an application online, which involved answering some questions and writing a cover letter. Exactly 8 days later, I was back in the office with 14 other young people ready to interview for a role in the Customer Experience team. The interview was split into three stages: the team task, the speed interviews an the one-on-one interviews. 1 week later, I got a call informing me that I had got the place in the customer experience team and would be starting at 9:30am on the first official day of my Easter holiday.

The first day...
